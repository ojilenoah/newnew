# Chapter 4: Design and Implementation

## 1. System Architecture Design

### 1.1 Architecture Overview

*[See Architecture Overview diagram in diagrams.md]*

### 1.2 Component Interactions

The BlockVote system architecture consists of four main layers that work together to provide a secure and transparent voting platform:

1. **Frontend Layer**:
   - Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
   - Provides separate interfaces for voters and administrators
   - Integrates with Web3 wallet providers (MetaMask and Phantom)
   - Implements responsive design with Shadcn UI components

2. **Backend Services**:
   - Express.js server handling API requests and authentication
   - Middleware for session management and security
   - Connects to Supabase for data persistence
   - Provides API endpoints for both voter and admin operations

3. **Blockchain Layer**:
   - Smart contracts deployed on Polygon Amoy testnet
   - Implements voting logic, election management, and vote counting
   - Uses Web3.js for blockchain interactions
   - Provides transaction verification and transparency

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Supabase for relational data storage
   - Stores user information, NIN verification status, and admin configurations
   - Blockchain for immutable vote storage and election data

### 1.3 Data Flow

*[See Data Flow diagram in diagrams.md]*

## 2. Implementation of Key Features

### 2.1 Voter Registration

The BlockVote system implements a secure voter registration process that combines traditional identity verification with blockchain technology:

#### Registration Flow

*[See Registration Flow diagram in diagrams.md]*

The voter registration flow follows a structured process to ensure security and data integrity:

1. **User Input**: The voter enters their National Identity Number (NIN) into the registration form.

2. **Input Validation**: The system validates the NIN format according to country-specific rules (length, character set, checksum).

3. **Wallet Verification**: The system checks if the user has connected a blockchain wallet (MetaMask or Phantom).

4. **Submission Process**: Once validated, the NIN is submitted along with the wallet address to the backend service.

5. **Duplicate Check**: The system verifies that neither the NIN nor the wallet address is already registered.

6. **Status Assignment**: The NIN is stored with an initial "unverified" status pending admin review.

7. **Confirmation**: The user receives confirmation of successful submission and instructions for next steps.

The entire flow incorporates multiple validation checks and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience while maintaining security requirements.
```

#### Security Measures

*[See Security Measures diagram in diagrams.md]*

1. **NIN Validation System**:
   - Format validation ensures NIN matches country-specific patterns
   - Length verification confirms the NIN contains the correct number of characters
   - Checksum algorithms validate the internal consistency of the NIN
   - Real-time feedback provides users with immediate information about validation errors

2. **Blockchain Address Binding**:
   - One-to-one relationship between wallet addresses and NIRs
   - Database constraints prevent duplicate registrations
   - Transaction signing verifies wallet ownership before registration
   - Wallet address serves as the primary identifier for all voting transactions

3. **Database Storage Architecture**:
   - Relational database structure with the following schema:
     - `wallet_address`: Primary key, unique identifier linked to blockchain identity
     - `nin`: Encrypted NIN information, secured with industry-standard encryption
     - `status`: Binary verification state ('Y' for verified, 'N' for pending verification)
     - `created_at`: Timestamp recording registration date and time
   - Submissions are initially stored with unverified status pending admin review
   - Data access is restricted through role-based permissions
   - Automatic locking mechanism prevents registration modifications during active elections
```

4. **Admin Verification**: An admin interface allows authorized users to verify submitted NIRs and mark them as eligible to vote.

### 2.2 Ballot Casting

The ballot casting process is the core feature of the BlockVote system, where the actual voting takes place securely on the blockchain:

#### Vote Casting Flow

*[See Vote Casting Flow diagram in diagrams.md]*

The vote casting process follows these steps:

1. **Candidate Selection**: The voter selects a candidate from the available options in the active election.

2. **Vote Initiation**: Upon clicking the "Cast Vote" button, the system initiates the voting process.

3. **Identity Protection**: The voter's NIN is hashed using SHA-256 to protect their identity while still preventing duplicate voting.

4. **Wallet Connection**: The Web3 provider (MetaMask or Phantom) is initialized and the voter is prompted to approve the transaction.

5. **Duplicate Check**: Before processing the vote, the system checks if the voter has already cast a vote in the current election.

6. **Blockchain Transaction**:
   - If the voter hasn't voted yet, the system creates a blockchain transaction
   - The smart contract receives the vote data (election ID, candidate ID, voter hash)
   - The transaction is signed by the voter's private key and broadcast to the network
   - The blockchain miners validate and add the transaction to a block

7. **Confirmation Processing**:
   - Once the transaction is confirmed, the voter's status is updated in the database
   - The user is presented with a transaction receipt containing the transaction hash
   - This hash serves as proof of voting that can be verified on the blockchain explorer

8. **Error Handling**: Throughout the process, comprehensive error handling ensures voters receive clear messages about any issues.

#### Blockchain Vote Recording Mechanism

*[See Blockchain Vote Recording Mechanism diagram in diagrams.md]*

The blockchain recording process involves several technical components:

1. **Smart Contract Interaction**: The application communicates with the deployed VotingSystem smart contract on the Polygon Amoy testnet.

2. **Web3 Provider**: The system uses Web3.js and Ethers.js to interface between the frontend application and the blockchain network.

3. **Transaction Processing**:
   - The transaction includes the election ID, candidate index, and hashed NIN
   - Gas fees are calculated and displayed to the voter before confirmation
   - The transaction is broadcast to the Polygon network for validation

4. **Double-Vote Prevention**: Multiple safeguards prevent duplicate voting:
   - Frontend checks to disable vote button after voting
   - Smart contract verification using the hashed NIN as identifier
   - Database status tracking to prevent multiple vote attempts

5. **Transaction Receipts**: When a vote is recorded, a detailed receipt is generated containing:
   - Transaction hash (unique identifier)
   - Block number where the transaction was recorded
   - Timestamp of the vote
   - Candidate information (without revealing the choice to observers)

#### Anonymity and Privacy Mechanisms

*[See Anonymity and Privacy Mechanisms diagram in diagrams.md]*

The system implements multiple layers of privacy protection to ensure voter anonymity while maintaining election integrity:

1. **Identity Protection through Cryptographic Hashing**:
   - Personal identifiers (NIRs) are transformed using SHA-256 cryptographic hashing
   - The one-way hashing algorithm prevents reverse-engineering of the original NIN
   - Each hash is prefixed with "0x" to conform with blockchain standards
   - The same NIN always produces the same hash, enabling duplicate vote detection

2. **Blockchain Privacy Architecture**:
   - Only the NIN hash is stored on the blockchain, never the actual identifier
   - The hash serves as a pseudonymous identifier that cannot be traced back to an individual
   - Votes are linked to the hash rather than to personal information
   - The immutable nature of blockchain prevents after-the-fact vote manipulation

3. **Data Segregation Strategy**:
   - Voter identity information is stored separately from voting records
   - The centralized database contains verification status but not voting choices
   - The blockchain contains voting choices but not personal identifiers
   - No single database contains both identity and vote choice information

4. **Technical Implementation of Privacy**:
   - Web3 wallet connections maintain user control over private keys
   - HTTPS encryption for all data transmission between components
   - Database access controls limit viewing of sensitive information
   - Automatic data purging after election completion for non-blockchain components

## 3. Smart Contract Development

### 3.1 Smart Contract Structure

*[See Smart Contract Structure diagram in diagrams.md]*

The BlockVote smart contract architecture is centered around a main `VotingSystem` contract that manages all election-related functionality. The contract was developed using Solidity and deployed on the Polygon Amoy testnet.

#### Data Structures

1. **Candidate Structure**:
   - Stores information about each election candidate
   - Properties include:
     - `name`: The candidate's full name
     - `party`: The political party or affiliation of the candidate
     - `votes`: Running tally of votes received by the candidate

2. **Election Structure**:
   - Represents a complete election with all its properties
   - Core attributes:
     - `name`: Title of the election (e.g., "Presidential Election 2025")
     - `startTime` & `endTime`: Unix timestamps defining the voting period
     - `active`: Boolean flag indicating if the election is currently active
     - `candidates`: Mapping of candidate index to Candidate object
     - `candidateCount`: Total number of candidates in the election
     - `hasVoted`: Mapping of voter NIN hash to voting status (prevents double voting)

3. **Storage Architecture**:
   - `admin`: Address of the contract administrator with special privileges
   - `activeElectionId`: ID of the currently active election
   - `electionCount`: Total number of elections created (also used for ID generation)
   - `elections`: Primary data store mapping election IDs to Election structures

#### Core Functionality

The contract implements several key functions:

1. **Administrative Functions**:
   - `createElection`: Creates a new election with specified parameters
   - `activateElection`: Activates a specific election and deactivates any currently active one
   - `changeAdmin`: Transfers administrative control to a new blockchain address

2. **Voting Functions**:
   - `castVote`: Records a vote for a specific candidate in an active election
   - `hasVoted`: Checks if a specific voter (identified by NIN hash) has already voted

3. **Getter Functions**:
   - `getElectionInfo`: Retrieves general information about an election
   - `getCandidate`: Fetches details about a specific candidate
   - `getActiveElectionId`: Returns the ID of the currently active election

4. **Events**:
   - `ElectionCreated`: Triggered when a new election is created
   - `VoteCast`: Emitted when a vote is successfully cast
   - `AdminChanged`: Fired when administrative control is transferred

#### Security Features

The smart contract implements several security measures:

1. **Access Control**:
   - `onlyAdmin` modifier restricts sensitive functions to the designated administrator
   - Function-level validations ensure operations are performed by authorized parties

2. **Input Validation**:
   - All public functions include parameter validation
   - Time-based constraints (e.g., `startTime < endTime`) prevent logical errors

3. **State Protection**:
   - Checks for election existence before operations
   - Prevents duplicate voting through the `hasVoted` mapping
   - Validates candidate indices to prevent out-of-bounds access

4. **Time Constraints**:
   - Enforces election periods using blockchain timestamps
   - Prevents voting before start time or after end time
```
