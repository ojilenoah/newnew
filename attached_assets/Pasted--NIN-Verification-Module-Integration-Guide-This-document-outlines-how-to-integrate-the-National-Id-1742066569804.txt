# NIN Verification Module Integration Guide

This document outlines how to integrate the National Identification Number (NIN) verification module as a new page within your existing application. The module will be accessible via the "Register" button in your main application's navbar.

## Overview

The NIN verification module will be implemented as a dedicated page that allows:
- User authentication via MetaMask
- NIN submission and verification
- Status checking for verified users
- Administrative controls for managing verifications

## Integration Approach

### Navigation & Access

The NIN verification module will be accessible through:
1. The existing navigation bar on your homepage
2. A "Register" button that directs users to the verification page

### Supabase Connection

The module will connect to your existing Supabase project:
- **Project URL**: https://fiufvpeumrdvkwjawbwu.supabase.co
- **Anon Key**: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImZpdWZ2cGV1bXJkdmt3amF3Ynd1Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDE2MDMxNDYsImV4cCI6MjA1NzE3OTE0Nn0.ysgSIqoP9E9fXU2y83yHm6APg7lnbZoBA6hKUktsoD4

### Database Tables

The module will interact with two Supabase tables:
1. `users` - Stores user NIN and verification status
2. `admin_config` - Manages system settings like lock status

## User Journey

### For Regular Users

1. **Access Point**: Click the "Register" button in the main application's navbar
2. **Authentication**: Connect MetaMask wallet when prompted
3. **Initial Check**: System verifies if the wallet address is already registered
   - If registered: Display NIN and verification status
   - If new: Prompt for NIN submission

4. **NIN Submission**:
   - Enter 11-digit NIN
   - System validates format and checks if submissions are locked
   - Upon successful submission, status is set to "N" (Not Verified)

5. **Status Checking**:
   - Users can return to check if their status has been updated to "Y" (Verified)

### For Administrators

1. **Authentication**: Admin connects using authorized MetaMask wallet
2. **Dashboard Access**: System recognizes admin wallet and displays additional controls
3. **Management Features**:
   - View all submitted NINs and their status
   - Update verification status from "N" to "Y" for legitimate entries
   - Toggle lock/unlock for new NIN submissions

## UI/UX Considerations

The NIN verification page will:
- Match the overall design language of your main application
- Use the same color scheme and typography
- Feature responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Provide clear status indicators and error messages
- Include loading states for database operations

## Security Measures

The integration will implement:
1. Wallet address verification for all operations
2. Admin-only access controls for sensitive functions
3. Input validation for NIN submissions
4. Unique constraint enforcement on NIN entries
5. Error handling for failed connections or transactions

## State Management

The verification module will:
- Track user authentication state
- Store wallet connection status
- Cache verification status to minimize database calls
- Monitor admin privileges when applicable

## Implementation Notes

When integrating this module:
- Ensure proper route configuration in your main application
- Update your navigation component to include the Register link
- Configure proper authentication flows between the main app and the verification module
- Test thoroughly for seamless transitions between application sections

This module serves as an essential registration step within your larger application, providing a secure and streamlined way to verify users' National Identification Numbers against their blockchain identities.
